                                        By Maya Angelou "</string>
    <string name="p1">"

         Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
         I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
         But when I start to tell them,
         They think I'm telling lies.
         I say,
         It's in the reach of my arms
         The span of my hips,
         The stride of my step,
         The curl of my lips.
         I'm a woman
         Phenomenally.
         Phenomenal woman,
         That's me.

         I walk into a room
         Just as cool as you please,
         And to a man,
         The fellows stand or
         Fall down on their knees.
         Then they swarm around me,
         A hive of honey bees.
         I say,
         It's the fire in my eyes,
         And the flash of my teeth,
         The swing in my waist,
         And the joy in my feet.
         I'm a woman
         Phenomenally.
         Phenomenal woman,
         That's me.

         Men themselves have wondered
         What they see in me.
         They try so much
         But they can't touch
         My inner mystery.
         When I try to show them
         They say they still can't see.
         I say,
         It's in the arch of my back,
         The sun of my smile,
         The ride of my breasts,
         The grace of my style.
         I'm a woman

         Phenomenally.
         Phenomenal woman,
         That's me.

         Now you understand
         Just why my head's not bowed.
         I don't shout or jump about
         Or have to talk real loud.
         When you see me passing
         It ought to make you proud.
         I say,
         It's in the click of my heels,
         The bend of my hair,
         the palm of my hand,
         The need of my care,
         'Cause I'm a woman
         Phenomenally.
         Phenomenal woman,
         That's me."

     <string name="p2">"
          There is a place where the sidewalk ends
          And before the street begins,
          And there the grass grows soft and white,
          And there the sun burns crimson bright,
          And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
          To cool in the peppermint wind.

          Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
          And the dark street winds and bends.
          Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
          We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
          And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
          To the place where the sidewalk ends.

          Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
          And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
          For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
          The place where the sidewalk ends.

          Take this kiss upon the brow!
          And, in parting from you now,
          Thus much let me avow--
          You are not wrong, who deem
          That my days have been a dream;
          Yet if hope has flown away
          In a night, or in a day,
          In a vision, or in none,
          Is it therefore the less gone?
          All that we see or seem
          Is but a dream within a dream.

          I stand amid the roar
          Of a surf-tormented shore,
          And I hold within my hand
          Grains of the golden sand--
          How few! yet how they creep
          Through my fingers to the deep,
          While I weep--while I weep!
          O God! can I not grasp
          Them with a tighter clasp?
          O God! can I not save
          One from the pitiless wave?
          Is all that we see or seem
          But a dream within a dream?

          Between my finger and my thumb
          The squat pin rest; snug as a gun.

          Under my window, a clean rasping sound
          When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
          My father, digging. I look down

          Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
          Bends low, comes up twenty years away
          Stooping in rhythm through potato drills
          Where he was digging.

          The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
          Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
          He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
          To scatter new potatoes that we picked,
          Loving their cool hardness in our hands.

          By God, the old man could handle a spade.
          Just like his old man.

          My grandfather cut more turf in a day
          Than any other man on Toner's bog.
          Once I carried him milk in a bottle
          Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
          To drink it, then fell to right away
          Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods
          Over his shoulder, going down and down
          For the good turf. Digging.

          The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
          Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
          Through living roots awaken in my head.
          But I've no spade to follow men like them.

          Between my finger and my thumb
          The squat pen rests.
          I'll dig with it.

          I want you to know
          one thing.

          You know how this is:
          if I look
          at the crystal moon, at the red branch
          of the slow autumn at my window,
          if I touch
          near the fire
          the impalpable ash
          or the wrinkled body of the log,
          everything carries me to you,
          as if everything that exists,
          aromas, light, metals,
          were little boats
          that sail
          toward those isles of yours that wait for me.

          Well, now,
          if little by little you stop loving me
          I shall stop loving you little by little.

          If suddenly
          you forget me
          do not look for me,
          for I shall already have forgotten you.

          If you think it long and mad,
          the wind of banners
          that passes through my life,
          and you decide
          to leave me at the shore
          of the heart where I have roots,
          remember
          that on that day,
          at that hour,
          I shall lift my arms
          and my roots will set off
          to seek another land.

          But
          if each day,
          each hour,
          you feel that you are destined for me
          with implacable sweetness,
          if each day a flower
          climbs up to your lips to seek me,
          ah my love, ah my own,
          in me all that fire is repeated,
          in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
          my love feeds on your love, beloved,
          and as long as you live it will be in your arms
          without leaving mine

          To me a painted paroquet
          Hath been—most familiar bird—
          Taught me my alphabet to say,
          To lisp my very earliest word
          While in the wild wood I did lie,
          A child—with a most knowing eye.

          Of late, eternal condor years
          So shake the very Heaven on high

          I have no time for idle cares
